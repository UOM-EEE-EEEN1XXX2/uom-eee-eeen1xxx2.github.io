Course policies
===============
If you're a student at the Univeristy of Manchester, enrolled on this course for course credit, there are certain rules and policies that you have to follow in order to gain marks. Mainly these are around academic malpractice, and the requirements are detailed in this section. This includes a discussion on acceptable and unacceptable use of artificial intelligence to help with your coding. 

If you're following these course notes online, then the requirements in this section give the practice that we follow in Manchester, but they don't strictly apply to you.
