Alex Casson is Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Manchester. He is a specialist in non-invasive bioelectronic interfaces: the design and application of wearable sensors, and skin-conformal flexible sensors, for human body monitoring and data analysis from highly artefact prone naturalistic situations. This work is highly multi-disciplinary, spanning ultra-low power sensing, signal processing and machine learning in power constrained rich environments, and real-time data analysis towards closed loop systems for remote monitoring and digital therapeutics. He has research experience in:

- Manufacturing using 3D printing, screen printing, and inkjet printing.
- Ultra low power microelectronic circuit and system design at the discrete and fully custom microchip levels.
- Sensor signal processing and machine learning for power and time constrained motion artefact rich environments.
- Using bespoke and off-the-shelf wearable devices in a wide range of environments.

Further details on his research are available `on his main research website. <https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alex.casson>`_ He is currently based in the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, and has previously been a Fellow of the Turing Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 

At the University of Manchester he has taught on a wide number of undergraduate courses (in addition to this course):

- First year: Small group tutorials.
- Second year: Digital Systems Design II.
- Second year: Signals and Systems.
- Third year: Individual project.
- Fourth year: Team project.
- Masters: Digital Control and Systems Identification.
- Masters: Individual dissertation.
- All years: Academic advisor.
