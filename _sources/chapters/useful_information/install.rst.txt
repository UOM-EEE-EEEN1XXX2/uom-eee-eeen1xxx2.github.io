Getting access to a programming environment
-------------------------------------------
The tools needed for programming are probably not pre-installed on your computer. You'll need to get access to them before you can carry out the practical aspects of the course. There are a number of different ways in which you can do this, detailed below.

These notes use:

- VSCode to write and debug our programs.
- git as the version control system to keep track of multiple copies of our program files.
- Python 3.12 or higher, Rust 2021 or newer, Powershell/bash/zsh, clang as a C/C++ compiler.
- Widows as the operating systems (screenshots will be from Windows).

The exact version of each tool should not be critical, but there may be minor differences depending on the exact version you use, and so we provide a route (below) to ensure everyone is using the same versions.

If you choose to use different tools, and there are many different ones to choose from, we'll do our best to support you, but it may be you need to change to using these supported tools. We deliberately use VSCode, for example, because it is open source, cross-platform, and widely used with lots of community support online. Using it on Windows, macOS or Linux should present no problem. Using alternative tools will make it much harder for us to support you - we don't know the intricasies of every possible platform that's out there. 

Remember that tools are very configurable, with lots of different options and customisations available. Don't worry if your set up looks a bit different to the ones in the screenshots used in the teaching materials, as long as it works!

Whichever method you pick, for the in-person exam you should be familiar with how to :ref:`run VSCode on a University computer. <computer_cluster>` Make sure you take the time to familiarise yourself with this, even if you do most of your coding on a personal device.

The four options for accessing the tools are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   install/devcontainer
   install/codespaces
   install/computer_cluster
   install/personal_device

Our reccomended appraoch is :ref:`to use the devcontainer. <devcontainer>`
