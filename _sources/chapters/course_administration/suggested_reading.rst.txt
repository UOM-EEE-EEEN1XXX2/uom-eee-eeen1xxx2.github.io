Suggested reading
-----------------
These notes are self-contained. Nevertheless, as outlined in :ref:`the unit delivery plan<unit_delivery_plan>` you are expected to carry out independent reading as part of your studies. More generally, there's no need to restrict your learning to the contents of these notes! When debugging code, most people will find support by searching for topics online, so search and see works best for you. As programming is a very important skill to learn, there are many different sources of additional information you can make use of. The below are some starting suggestions.
