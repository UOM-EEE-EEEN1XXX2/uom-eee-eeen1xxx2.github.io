Course materials
----------------
We have made a wide range of materials to support your learning:

- These online lecture and lab notes are the primary learning material for the course. You should read through them, and work through the lab exercises. 

- The notes include short quiz material to help you test your knowledge.

- Brief video explainers are placed at key points in the lecture notes. These videos are not intended to cover every aspects of the course - this is fundamentally a text based course and the lecture notes the main source of content. Rather, these videos are to help explain subtle concepts, or used when a practical illustration is more informative than text. 

- In addition, there are 12 week-by-week videos, one for each week of the course. These highlight the key concepts and aims for that week of the unit, to help you move through the material. 

- For students at the University of Manchester, there is a discussion forum on Canvas. 

- For students at the University of Manchester, there are also lecture slots each week. The video recording of these will be on Canvas.  


Assessments
-----------
There are two parts to the assessment of your learning in the course:

Formative
^^^^^^^^^
There are 20 lab based assignments, one for each lab session, that need to be submitted to an online system for marking. These contribute 50% to the overall unit mark. 

There is just one deadline for all of these, at the end of the course. See the :ref:`unit delivery plan <unit_delivery_plan>` for the exact date. However, they are intended to be tackled week-by-week to help you track your progress through the course and to let us give :ref:`feedback <feedback>` on your work.

Detailed instructions are given on the Labs page. 

Summative
^^^^^^^^^
There is an unseen closed book exam at the end of the course. This contributes 50% of the overall unit mark.

This is a computer based exam. It will consist of a mixture of knowledge based questions (such as multiple choice, fill in the blank), and coding tasks. In coding tasks you will be asked to complete short programs (like you might be asked in a job interview) and will have to upload your code for marking.

Feedback
--------

Our feedback to you
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The primary opportunity for getting feedback on your work is in the lab sessions. Be proactive in requesting this. We will have lots of demonstrators on-hand to answer your questions and to give you feedback or suggestions on your work. This will be formative feedback, to help guide your future work. 

The other sources for feedback to you are:

- Formative: Each lab requires you to upload some code to check your understanding. The online system will analyze your work, and give some feedback if the code doesn't work as expected. (These are the same as the formative assessments noted above.)

- Formative: Each topic in the course notes has a short quiz at the end of it. Use these to test your knowledge, moving on to the next topic only once you've completed the quiz to your satisfaction.

- Formative: We have two in-person lecture sessions each week. In these we will go over key topics, as well as go over answers to the short quizzes, highlighting common issues. We will also perform code reviews for code submitted in the labs, giving suggestions for improving the code quality. 

- Summative: There is an unseen exam at the end of the course. The marks and class feedback will help you to evaluate your work and where you sit within the cohort.


Your feedback to us
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For feedback to us, please make use of the lecture and lab sessions to talk to us.

Each of the short quizzes also has an open question at the end where you can enter free text comments to tell us about any issues, or questions that you would like addressing.

You can also click the edit on GitHub button (|ico1|) in the lecture notes, at the top of each page, to make suggestions for edits or additions to the material.

Feedback timelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All formative feedback is in real-time. The marking system will give feedback comments within a few minutes of work being submitted.

Summative feedback is released after the end of the course, together with the results for all other units at the University of Manchester.
